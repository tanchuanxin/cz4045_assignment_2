# Word-level language modeling (FNN, LSTM, Transformer)

### Installation and Required Packages
We have already included the dataset here in the ```data/wikitext-2 folder```. All that is required is to install the python packages 
```bash 
pip install -r requirements.txt # Install required python packages
```

### Running Guide
We have simplified the model running into shell scripts. Please run these shell scripts on a GPU-enabled machine
```bash
sh batch.sh             # Trains FNN, LSTM and Transformer models with Adam Optimzer with both tied and not tied weights
sh rms_batch.sh         # Trains FNN Model with RMS Optimizer for comparison of results with Adam optimizer run in batch.sh
sh generate_text.sh     # Generate text for all models from batch.sh and rms_batch.sh  
```

### Outputs
We log the metrics and the generated texts in separate folders. Please open the respective folders to take a look
```bash
generated               # 1000 word text generated by our models
logs                    # csv files logging the perplexity score and validation loss
models                  # stores the model .pt files that can be used to recreate models and generate predictions
```

Model files are too large to host on github. Please access this <a href="https://entuedu-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/ctan184_e_ntu_edu_sg/Ec8ziK38bbhDsG5-xeb_my0BTE2Gqjidf5_gbJBp49KgKg?e=Npl8kM"> LINK </a> to download them instead.


### Visualization
```bash
jupyter_notebooks/Visualization.ipynb   # contains some of the graphs that we have chosen to visualize
```
